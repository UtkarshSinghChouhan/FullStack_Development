Declaring variables in JavaScript is essential for storing and managing 
data within a program. Variables act as containers that hold values, and 
they play a crucial role in making your code dynamic and reusable. You can 
declare variables using the let keyword in JavaScript. Here's an 
explanation of the purpose of declaring variables and how to use the let 
keyword to declare them:


Purpose of Declaring Variables:

Storage: Variables are used to store and hold data values. These values can 
be numbers, text, boolean values, objects, or any other data type.

Manipulation: Variables allow you to manipulate and perform operations on 
data. You can change the value of a variable, perform calculations, and 
more.

Reusability: By storing data in variables, you can reuse the data in 
different parts of your code. This promotes code modularity and avoids 
redundancy.

Scope: Variables have scope, meaning they can be accessed within specific 
parts of your code. They can be local (limited to a function or block) or 
global (accessible throughout the code).



Using the 'let' Keyword to Declare Variables:

let variableName; // Declaration without initialization
let age = 30; // Declaration and initialization
let firstName = "John", lastName = "Doe", age = 25; // Multiple variable declarations
