Comments in JavaScript, like in many programming languages, serve as a way 
to add explanatory notes or annotations within your code. They are not 
executed by the JavaScript interpreter and are primarily meant for human 
readers, including yourself and other developers who may work with your 
code. 

Comments are important for several reasons:

Documentation: Comments provide essential documentation for your code, 
explaining the purpose of variables, functions, and code blocks. They make 
it easier for other developers (or your future self) to understand and 
maintain the code.

Clarity: Comments can clarify complex or obscure code sections, making it 
easier to follow the logic and functionality of your program.

Debugging: Comments can help you isolate and identify issues during 
debugging by describing the expected behavior of your code.

TODOs: You can use comments to mark tasks that need to be addressed in the 
future, such as "TODO" or "FIXME" comments, which serve as reminders.

Version Control: Comments can be used in version control systems like Git 
to provide context and descriptions for code changes.



Single-Line Comment:

// This is a single-line comment. It is used to provide a brief explanation on one line.

let age = 30; // This comment explains that 'age' variable holds the age of a person.

Here are examples of single-line and multi-line comments in JavaScript:



Multi-Line Comment:

/*
   This is a multi-line comment.
   It can span multiple lines and is useful for more extensive explanations.
   For example, you can provide function or module documentation here.
*/
let fullName = "John Doe";
