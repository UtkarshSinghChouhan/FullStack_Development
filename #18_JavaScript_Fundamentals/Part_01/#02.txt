JavaScript and HTML are fundamental technologies used in web development, 
but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here 
are the key differences between JavaScript and HTML, along with examples of 
situations where you would use each:


Purpose:

JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity 
and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows you to create functions, 
control logic, and respond to user interactions.

HTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used for 
structuring the content and layout of a web page. It defines the structure 
and elements of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and 
forms.


Syntax:

JavaScript: JavaScript uses a more traditional programming syntax with 
variables, loops, conditions, and functions. Here's a simple JavaScript 
function.

function greet(name) {
    alert('Hello, ' + name + '!');
}

HTML: HTML uses tags to define elements and their attributes. Here's an 
example of an HTML paragraph element:

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>


Interactivity:

JavaScript: JavaScript is responsible for creating interactive features 
like form validation, animations, and real-time updates. For example, you 
can use JavaScript to validate a user's input in a form before submission.

HTML: HTML primarily defines the structure and content of the web page but 
does not provide interactivity on its own.


Examples of Usage:

JavaScript:
Form validation: Checking if user inputs are valid before submission.

Dynamic content: Updating content without refreshing the entire page (e.g., 
chat applications).

Animations and transitions: Creating visually appealing effects on a web 
page.

HTML:
Document structure: Defining headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables.

Hyperlinks: Creating links to navigate between web pages.

Images: Embedding images in a web page using <img> tags.
