Promises and callbacks are both used for managing asynchronous
code in JavaScript, but they have different characteristics and
usage patterns. Here's a comparison between Promises and
callbacks, along with reasons why Promises are often preferred:

Callback Functions:

    Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to 
    other functions and executed asynchronously at a later time
    , typically after an asynchronous operation completes.

    Callbacks can lead to "callback hell" or "pyramid of doom"
    when dealing with multiple nested asynchronous operations,
    making the code hard to read and maintain.

    Error handling in callback-based code can become complex,
    as errors need to be propagated through multiple layers of
    nested callbacks.


Promises:
    Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of
    an asynchronous operation and provide a cleaner and more
    structured way to handle asynchronous code.

    Promises have built-in support for chaining multiple
    asynchronous operations together, making it easier to
    manage complex asynchronous workflows and avoid callback
    hell.

    Promises provide better error handling through the .catch()
    method, which allows errors to be handled in a centralized
    manner, regardless of where they occur in the chain of 
    asynchronous operations.
    
    Promises can be combined with other features like 
    async/await syntax to write asynchronous code in a more
    synchronous style, improving readability and 
    maintainability.


    Reasons why Promises are preferred for managing asynchronous code:

Readability: 
    Promises provide a more readable and maintainable way to write asynchronous code compared to callbacks, especially for complex asynchronous workflows with multiple nested operations.

Error Handling: 
    Promises offer better error handling capabilities through the use of the .catch() method, allowing errors to be handled in a centralized manner without the need for nested error callbacks.    

Chaining: 
    Promises support method chaining (then()), which allows for a more sequential and declarative style of coding, making it easier to understand the flow of asynchronous operations.

Composition: 
    Promises can be easily composed and combined using methods like Promise.all() and Promise.race(), enabling developers to orchestrate complex asynchronous tasks more effectively.

Async/Await: 
    The introduction of async/await syntax in JavaScript (built on top of Promises) further enhances the readability and simplicity of asynchronous code, allowing developers to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code.
