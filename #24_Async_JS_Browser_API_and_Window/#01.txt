The XMLHttpRequest object is a built-in JavaScript object that provides an easy way to retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. It is commonly used to make asynchronous HTTP requests (AJAX requests) to web servers from within a web page.

Here's a brief overview of how XMLHttpRequest works and its usage in AJAX:

    1. Creating an XMLHttpRequest Object: To create an instance of the XMLHttpRequest object, you can use the new XMLHttpRequest() constructor.

        const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

    2. Configuring the Request: After creating the XMLHttpRequest object, you can configure the request using methods such as open() and setRequestHeader().

        xhr.open('GET', 'https://example.com/data', true); // Method, URL, Async (true/false)
        xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');

    3. Handling Response: You can define event listeners to handle various stages of the request-response cycle, such as onload, onerror, onreadystatechange, etc.

        xhr.onload = function() {
            if (xhr.status === 200) {
                console.log(xhr.responseText); // Response data
            }
        };

    4.Sending the Request: After configuring the request, you can send it using the send() method.

        xhr.send();

    5.Processing Response: Once the response is received, you can process the data in the callback function attached to the `onload` event or other appropriate events.
