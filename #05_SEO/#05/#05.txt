Favicon:

A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small, typically square image or icon that is associated with a website
or web page. Favicon images are displayed in various places within web browsers, such as next to the website's
name in the browser tab, in bookmarks or favorites lists, and in browser history.

Favicons serve several purposes:

Branding: Favicons are often used to display a website's logo or a distinctive symbol, reinforcing 
brand identity and recognition.

Visual Identification: They help users visually identify and locate a specific website among their 
open tabs or bookmarks.

Professionalism: Including a favicon adds a professional touch to a website, enhancing its overall
appearance.
