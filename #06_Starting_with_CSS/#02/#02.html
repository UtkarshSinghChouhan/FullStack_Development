  <!-- We use the BEM naming convention to create class names for our paragraphs:

.paragraph is the class applied to all paragraphs to define the base styling.
.paragraph__intro and .paragraph__main are the classes applied to specific paragraphs to indicate their purpose or type.
.paragraph__warning is the class with a modifier to indicate a warning and apply distinct styling. -->
