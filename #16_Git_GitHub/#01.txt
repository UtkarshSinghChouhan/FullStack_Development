Version control, also known as source code control or revision control, is a system that manages changes
to files, documents, or any set of data over time. Its primary role in software development is to track
and manage different versions of a project's source code and related files, ensuring collaboration, organization,
and history tracking. Here's a concise explanation of version control and its role in software development:

Version Control:
- Version control is a system that tracks changes made to files over time, allowing multiple people to collaborate
  on the same project without conflicts.
- It records each modification, including who made the change, when it was made, and what was changed.
- It enables the organization of code into different versions or branches, making it easier to manage and maintain.

Role in Software Development:
- Collaboration: It facilitates collaboration among developers by providing a central repository where they can share
  and coordinate their work on a project.
- History Tracking: Version control keeps a history of changes, which helps diagnose issues, roll back to previous working
  states, and understand the evolution of the project.
- Code Backup: It serves as a backup system, ensuring that code and project assets are not lost due to accidental deletions
  or overwrites.
- Parallel Development: Developers can work on different features or fixes in parallel without interfering with each other's
  work, thanks to branches and merging.
- Quality Control: It helps maintain code quality by enforcing best practices, code review processes, and integration testing.
- Rollbacks and Bug Fixes: In case of bugs or issues, version control allows for the quick identification of when and how a 
  problem was introduced, making it easier to fix.
- Release Management: It supports the management of different versions of a software product for testing, staging, and production
  environments.
- Auditing and Compliance: It provides an audit trail, which is valuable for compliance, security, and accountability.

Common version control systems include Git, Subversion, Mercurial, and Perforce. Git, in particular, is widely used in
the software development industry due to its distributed nature, speed, and robust branching and merging capabilities.
