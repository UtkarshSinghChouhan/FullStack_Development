Here are three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML:

1. Use Semantic HTML Elements: HTML5 introduced semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, and <footer>, among others. 
                               These elements provide a more meaningful structure to your content, making it easier for assistive technologies
                               and screen readers to interpret and present the information to users with disabilities. 

2. Provide Alternative Text for Images: Images play a significant role in web content, and it's crucial to provide alternative text (alt text) 
                                        for images using the alt attribute in the <img> element. Alt text should be descriptive and convey the 
                                        purpose or content of the image. Screen readers use alt text to describe images to users who cannot see them.



3. Ensure Keyboard Accessibility: Ensure that all interactive elements on your website are navigable
                                  and usable with a keyboard. Use the tabindex attribute to control the tab order, and provide visible
                                  focus styles for interactive elements like buttons and links.
