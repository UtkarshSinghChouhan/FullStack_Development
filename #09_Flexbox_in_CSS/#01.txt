The main difference between the CSS Flexbox layout and the CSS Grid layout model lies
in how they handle the arrangement and positioning of elements in a web page:

1. CSS Flexbox Layout:
   - Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row (horizontally) or in a column (vertically).
   - It focuses on distributing space along a single axis, which makes it ideal for arranging items within 
     a container in a linear fashion.
   - Elements inside a flex container can have different heights or widths, and Flexbox will automatically
     adjust their sizes to fit the available space.
   - It's well-suited for creating navigation menus, aligning items within a single row or column, and 
     for responsive designs where you want elements to adapt to varying screen sizes.

2. CSS Grid Layout:
   - Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to create both rows and columns to arrange
     elements in a grid-like structure.
   - It provides precise control over both rows and columns, making it suitable for complex layouts where you
     need to align items in both directions.
   - Grid allows you to create grid tracks (rows and columns) with fixed or flexible sizes, and you can place
     items anywhere within the grid, spanning multiple cells if needed.
   - It's great for designing complex web page structures, such as magazine-style layouts, image galleries, and
     any design where content needs to be placed in a grid format.

When to Choose Flexbox or Grid:

1. Choose Flexbox when:
   - You need to arrange elements in a single row or column.
   - You want to distribute space along one axis.
   - You want elements to automatically adjust their sizes based on available space.
   - You are dealing with a more linear layout, like navigation bars or simple content containers.

2. Choose Grid when:
   - You need to create a two-dimensional grid layout with both rows and columns.
   - You want precise control over the placement of elements in rows and columns.
   - You have complex layouts that involve placing items in a grid structure.
   - You want to create responsive layouts that adapt to varying screen sizes, as Grid allows for more control in this regard.

In practice, you may also find that a combination of both Flexbox and Grid can be used within the same web page layout, as
they are not mutually exclusive and can complement each other to achieve different design goals. The choice between Flexbox and Grid should be based on the specific requirements of your design and layout needs.
