The DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML is a declaration at the beginning of an HTML document that specifies which version of HTML the document adheres to. It serves several important purposes:

    1. *Document Type Definition (DTD):* The DOCTYPE declaration refers to a Document Type Definition that defines the rules and structure of the document.
                                        It tells the web browser how to interpret and render the HTML content.

    2. *Rendering Mode:* The presence of a DOCTYPE declaration triggers the web browser to render the document in a specific rendering mode, known as "standards mode."
                        In this mode, the browser tries to adhere to the specified HTML standard, ensuring consistent and predictable rendering across different browsers.

    3. *Validation:* It allows for validation of the HTML document's syntax.
                     Browser use the DOCTYPE declaration to check whether the document follows the rules of the specified HTMLversion.

Here is an example of a DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5:

Below is the html-code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My Web Page</title>
    </head>s
    <body>
        <!-- Your content here -->
    </body>
</html>



In this example, `<!DOCTYPE html>` indicates that the document is using HTML5.
