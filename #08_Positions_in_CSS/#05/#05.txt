The CSS `z-index` property is used to control the stacking order of elements
on a web page along the z-axis (the depth axis, perpendicular to the screen). 
Elements with higher `z-index` values are stacked on top of elements with lower
`z-index` values. The `z-index` property applies only to positioned elements 
(elements with a `position` property value of `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`).



In the attached example:

1. We have three `div` elements with the class "box." These elements are absolutely positioned.

2. Each `.box` element has a different background color.

3. We set `z-index` values for each box:
   - The red box has a `z-index` of 1.
   - The blue box has a `z-index` of 2.
   - The green box has a `z-index` of 3.

Now, the stacking order is determined by the `z-index` values:

- The green box has the highest `z-index` and will be displayed on top of the other two boxes.
- The blue box has a higher `z-index` than the red box, so it will be displayed on top of the red box.
- The red box has the lowest `z-index` and will be at the bottom of the stacking order.
