Conditional statements in programming are used to make decisions and execute different code 
blocks based on certain conditions. These conditions are typically expressed as boolean expressions 
that evaluate to either true or false. Depending on the evaluation result, the program will take
different paths and execute different sets of instructions.

let x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
  console.log("x is greater than 5");
}

if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}

if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}

switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to be executed if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to be executed if expression === value2
    break;
  // More cases...
  default:
    // Code to be executed if none of the cases match
}

let day = "Monday";

switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("It's the start of the week");
    break;
  case "Friday":
    console.log("It's almost the weekend");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("It's a regular day");
}
